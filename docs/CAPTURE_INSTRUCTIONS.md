## Steps to Capture

1. **Open the app**: https://repo-insights-mu.vercel.app

2. **Enter a popular repository**:
   - Good examples: `facebook/react`, `vercel/next.js`, `microsoft/vscode`
   - These have rich data (many commits, contributors, languages)

3. **Wait for charts to load** (may take 5-10 seconds for first-time data)

4. **Set browser to consistent size**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Click "Toggle device toolbar" icon
   - Select "Laptop with HiDPI screen" or similar preset

5. **Take screenshot**:
   - Capture the full dashboard view showing:
     - Repository card (name, description, stars, forks)
     - Language breakdown chart (pie/donut chart)
     - Commit activity chart (line graph)
     - Contributor stats chart (bar chart)
   - Use Windows Snipping Tool, macOS Screenshot, or browser screenshot extension

6. **Save the screenshot**:
   - Format: PNG
   - File name: `dashboard.png`
   - Location: `/c/Repo/repo-insights/docs/dashboard.png`

7. **Optional**: Crop to remove browser chrome (address bar, bookmarks)
